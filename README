= acts_as_seo_friendly

This is a fork of revolutionhealth-acts_as_seo_friendly gem. This fork maintains all original functionality and is purely an upgrade for compatibility with rails 4.

== DESCRIPTION:

Create an SEO friendly field for a model automatically based on a given field.

So if you have a Blogs model, and you would like create an SEO friendly version 
of the 'title' field, you would just add this to your model and then be able to 
use the SEO friendly id as the unique id to the resource.  The plugin will only
append an integer to the SEO id if there is a collision.

== FEATURES/PROBLEMS:

* Only tested on mysql and sqlite3


== SYNOPSIS:


Create seo column migration:

 class CreateSeoTestModels < ActiveRecord::Migration
   def self.up
     create_table :seo_test_models do |t|
       t.string :name
       t.timestamps
     end
	 SeoTestModel.create_seo_friendly_column()
   end

   def self.down
	 SeoTestModel.drop_seo_friendly_column()
     drop_table :seo_test_models
   end
 end


Add to model:

 class SeoTestModel < ActiveRecord::Base
	acts_as_seo_friendly :resource_id => :name, 
					     :seo_friendly_id_field => :seo_id, # default is :seo_friendly_id
					     :seo_friendly_id_limit => 100 # default is 50
 end


To lookup the resource in the controllers use:

  SeoTestModel.find_by_seo_id(params[:id])
